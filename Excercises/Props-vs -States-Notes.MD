"Props" refers to the properties being 
passed into a component in order for it 
to work correctly, similar to how a function
recieves parameters: "from above." A component
receiving props is not allowed to modify those 
props. (i.e. they are "immutable.")

"State" referes to values that are
managed by the component, similar to
variables declared inside a function.
Any time you have changing values
that should be saved/displayed, you'll
likely be using state.
